### About me
I am Mike Smith - a life-long student of health and wellbeing. I have been living in Sydney, Australia for 10 years. I graduated from one of the best universities 5 years ago. Apart from just study, I am passionate about personal health and community activities. I live with my lovely 4 family members. During my university life, I regularly got involved in community works, health workshops and volunteering services.

Professionally, I got a chance to work in health sector. The experience working in health sector gave me the exposure how lifestyle impacts out health - especially in cancers. Yes, there are still some factors which are out of our controls like gender, genes but we can control most of other factors.
Interests: Cricket, Basketball, Reading, and Playing with my lovely kids.
